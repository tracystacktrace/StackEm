# StackEm (Stack 'Em)

Mod that adds multiple texturepack selection to ReIndev.

Tired of glueing several small texturepacks in one .zip file? Got you, this mod allows you to use several texturepacks simultaneously.

I'm not sure of stability, but everything should work fine. If not, please ping me in discord server asap.
