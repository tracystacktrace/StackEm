## [0.2] - 2025-06-15
- Some small optimization inserted
- Fixed a bug when a texturepack list can freak out
- Temporarily fixed action buttons' positions, will eventually be fixed in consequent versions
- Experimental: the mod now can manually join several same file textures by comparing pixels from vanilla. Right now, it is supported for following textures:
  - /textures/gui/effects.png
  - /textures/gui/gui.png
  - /textures/gui/icons.png
  - /textures/gui/web_buttons.png
  - /textures/gui/hud/hud.png
  - /textures/gui/stats/slot.png

Thanks to `toothydeerryte` and `rerere284` for help during this version development!
